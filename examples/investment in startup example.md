      "Proposal to use a small amount of the treasury to fund a game startup called ChainAttack that will store assets and run contracts for multiplayer games on Arbitrum. This will bring a lot of developers and investment to our space and investing early can allow the governance council to encourage growth in the gaming sector. The investment amount is quite small and the initial cash injection can buy 10% of the company, with the DAO as a beneficiary of the ownership it could look to sell it's stake in ChainAttack and invest in other areas of growth for Arbitrum. Any sale would have to pass another vote of course.",

## OUTPUT

## RESEARCH

### DAO Overview: Research Governance DAO

#### General DAO Information:

- **Name:** Research Governance DAO
- **Contract Address:** 0xb8eFb605822C9141E243F9951015bEC43645fa7b
- **Description:** This DAO governs the Arbitrum Stylus network.
- **Symbol:** ALG (token ticker).
- **Total Token Supply:** 1,000,000 ALG.
- **Circulating Token Supply:** 500,000 ALG (50% of total supply is in circulation).
- **Inflation Rate:** 5%.
- **Delegates' Tokens:** 445,000,000 ALG (This seems unusually high, likely a reporting issue needing clarification).

---

#### Treasury Status:

- **Issued Tokens in Treasury:** 2,880,000,000 ALG issued.
- **Staked Tokens in Treasury:** 1,200,000,000 ALG staked across 10 sources.
- **Locked Tokens:** No locked tokens currently (0 ALG).

Treasury appears liquid and primarily active in stable issuance and staking activities.

---

#### Smart Contract Functionalities:

- Includes functions to mint tokens, transfer balances, and manage staking/unstaking.
- Current treasury contract implementation offers no further insights beyond what is presented in balances above.

---

### Staking Distribution Analysis:

- The largest staker is **Address: 0x6Ee1Cc0Db59e31F43c6712759C9A20123FCa1815**, staking 100,000 ALG.  
   This staker holds **20% of circulating supply** if included in total staking activity. This strongly suggests this address qualifies as a **\"whale\"** in this ecosystem.

#### Whale Status on Proposal Submission:

- **Submitter Address:** 0x6Ee1Cc0Db59e31F43c6712759C9A20123FCa1815.  
   As the submitter is also staking the largest amount of tokens, they are likely an active whale participant.

---

### Tokenomics Overview:

- **Token Name:** ALG
- **Total Supply (across chain):** 15,300,000 ALG
- **Circulating Supply:** 6,900,000 ALG (45.1% in circulation).
- **Inflation Rate:** 0 (Stable; tokens are no longer inflating).

Notably, while the DAO specifies a 5% inflation rate for governance purposes, the overarching chain appears non-inflationary at this time.

---

### Submitted Proposal:

#### Proposal Action/Details:

- **Action Type:** Transfer of funds.
- **Action Description:** Transfer 100,000,000 ALG tokens to **submitter’s address (0x6Ee1Cc0Db59e31F43c6712759C9A20123FCa1815)** from the treasury.  
   This is **10% of treasury's currently available issued supply** (significant size for treasury activity).
- **Governing Contract:** Research Governance DAO contract (0xb8eFb605822C9141E243F9951015bEC43645fa7b).

---

### Key Observations for Governance Advisor:

1. **Whale Influence:**

   - The proposal submitter (Address: 0x6Ee1Cc0Db59e31F43c6712759C9A20123FCa1815) is a whale.
   - This whale controls 20% of the entire staking distribution, suggesting substantial influence over governance decisions.

2. **Tokenomics Stability:**

   - Circulating supply is under control, and no additional inflation has occurred in recent tokenomics data.

3. **Treasury Liquidity:**

   - Treasury remains liquid with substantial token reserves issued and staked. However, proposals to divert 100,000,000 ALG may erode liquidity long term if repeat proposals arise.

4. **Lack of Decentralization Signals in Proposals:**
   - As a whale both submits and benefits from the proposal, it raises potential conflicts of interest and questions surrounding decentralized governance participation.
   - Advisor should consider strategies to mitigate whale dominance.

## REPORT

### DAO Proposal Risk Assessment Report

#### 1️⃣ **Proposal Summary**

The proposal suggests utilizing a portion of the DAO treasury to invest in a gaming startup called ChainAttack. This would allocate funds equal to 10% ownership in the company, with the potential to benefit from future growth in the gaming sector on Arbitrum. All liquidation decisions would require governance approval through a follow-up vote.

---

#### 2️⃣ **Financial Risk Analysis:**

- **Treasury Impact:** The proposal would transfer 100,000,000 ALG tokens, amounting to 10% of the treasury’s current issued reserves. This is a significant allocation, which could limit treasury flexibility for other initiatives.
- **Tokenomics Impact:** No immediate minting, burning, or inflation changes are proposed, mitigating long-term tokenomic risks.
- **Liabilities Introduced:** The DAO essentially takes on a risky equity position with no guaranteed return. Failure of the startup could result in a total financial loss without secondary recourse.

**Summary of Financial Risks (Moderate):** While the transfer is large, it does not involve directly altering tokenomics. Investment in startups inherently carries the possibility of total loss, but potential upside exists if the venture succeeds.

---

#### 3️⃣ **Security Risk Analysis:**

- **Smart Contract or Permissions Change:** None specified in this proposal, as the funds will support equity acquisition rather than protocol-level changes.
- **Use of External Contracts:** Funds are allocated to an external third party (ChainAttack), introducing reliance on the performance and honesty of the external operational team.
- **Governance Attack Risk:** Although no technical vulnerabilities like reentrancy or misaligned descriptions are evident, the proposer is a significant whale. Their stake may unduly influence the governance outcome to serve their interests.

**Summary of Security Risks (Low-Moderate):** Main security risks stem from dependency on the third party’s behavior and lack of safeguards to prevent governance manipulation by a whale.

---

#### 4️⃣ **Governance Risk Analysis:**

- **Proposer’s Past Involvement:** The proposer has not submitted similar proposals before, according to the governance history, but they account for 20% of staking activity, indicating disproportionate sway.
- **Contradictory Proposals:** No conflicting proposals are active at the moment.
- **Conflict of Interest:** Proposer is a whale and direct beneficiary of treasury utilization. Transparency in how the proposer benefits from the deal remains vague.
- **Large Token Holder Advantage:** Yes, if the whale’s stake influences the vote toward personal financial benefit without equitable distribution of gains.
- **Urgency of Decision:** No evidence indicates an urgent timeline.

**Summary of Governance Risks (High):** Conflict of interest and disproportional whale influence significantly impact the fairness of the governance process.

---

#### Final Risk Score: **77**

This proposal presents **high governance risks** due to disproportionate influence by a whale and lack of mechanisms to ensure fair and unbiased decision-making. Additionally, financial risks remain moderate due to the inherent uncertainty of investing in a startup. The DAO should require more due diligence, ensure third-party validation of the investment’s return potential, and implement safeguards to minimize undue whale influence.",

`score: 77`
