# Sentinel: A Super-Intelligent Auditor for DAO Voters

Sentinel helps DAO voters understand new proposals and spot potential red flags before casting their votes. 

---

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring**  
   - The system watches a DAO contract for new proposals using TheGraph‚Äôs subgraph.  

2. **Storage**  
   - Sentinel's system stores full proposals off-chain in **NilDB**.  
   - A corresponding hash is stored on-chain to ensure tamper-proof verification.

3. **Sentinel's Combined AI Agent Workflow**  
   1. **Researcher Agent** (Hosted on Nillion‚Äôs nilAI)  
      - **Retrieves** the full proposal description from Nillion nodes.  
      - **Decodes** the proposal action (e.g., target address, treasury details, tokenomics, DAO stakers).  
      - **Compiles** a clear, structured report for review.  

   2. **Reviewer Agent** (Hosted on OpenAI)  
      - **Analyzes** the report from the Researcher Agent.  
      - **Creates** a detailed review focusing on:  
        - **Financial Risks** (e.g., budget implications)  
        - **Security Risks** (e.g., vulnerabilities in execution)  
        - **Governance Risks** (e.g., centralized control concerns)

4. **Storing & Verifying Reviews**  
   - Once the review is ready, its hash is stored on-chain.  
   - Voters can verify the on-chain hash against the original report stored in NilDB.

## Why Use Sentinel?

- **Informed Decisions**: Voters can make informed decisions without technical knowledge of onchain tokenomic implications 
- **Security & Trust**: Off-chain and on-chain components ensure proposals and reviews are both accessible and verifiable.  
- **Scalable Governance**: By automating proposal analysis, DAOs can grow more effectively without sacrificing transparency.

## Demo

For demo purposes, the Sentinel system is connected to a DAO deployed on Arbitrum. The steps are the same for other EVM-compatible chains‚Äîjust swap out the subgraph and configure NilDB accordingly.
