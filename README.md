## :mag: Agentic DAO Governance Simplified

Sentinel is an AI-Agentic platform designed to bring transparency into DAO governance by providing intelligent proposal analysis, secure storage, and onchain visualizations. Sentinel helps voters of DAOs make more informed and secure governance decisions.

- Generate comprehensive risk assessment
- Provide a 0-100 risk score covering financial, security, and governance risks
